## How to get help

We use a ticket system for supporting our products. The system is integrated with Envato Support which allows us to help you via email one-by-one.

**Please follow the steps bellow to get help:**

**Step 1:** Login to ThemeForest with your account that you used to bought our theme. On every item page, you will see a **Support** tab. Click on that tab and you will see the following screen:

**Step 3:** Enter your message and click **Send**.

Your message will be sent to our support system and you will receive a reply as fastest as possible.
