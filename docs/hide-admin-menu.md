*Welcome! First of all we want to thank you for purchasing our Hide Admin Menu plugin.*

In the following sections we will show you how to set up and use the plugin the easiest way possible. Although there're a lot of things written in this documentation, the plugin itself is not very hard to use. You can go to the plugin settings page and discover everything yourself. This file is more of a reference if you do not know what to do, or if you are not familiar with WordPress.

If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file, please feel free to ask your questions at the support ticket system.

## Usage

### Normal usage

### MultiSite usage

Since version 2.1, you can setup menu visibility for whole network only **ONCE**. You don't need to go to each blog admin page to setup the plugin anymore.

To do this, just go go **Network Dashboard -> Hide Admin Menu** and from here you can toggle menu items for all site at once, similarly to what you did for a single WordPress website.
